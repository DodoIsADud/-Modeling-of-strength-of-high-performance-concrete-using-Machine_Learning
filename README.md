# -Modeling-of-strength-of-high-performance-concrete-using-artificial-neural-networks

Fly ash and slag concrete (FSC) is such a highly complex material that modeling its 
behavior is a difficult task. In this paper, a method of modeling strength of FSC using 
artificial neural networks (ANN) is presented. The strength is a function of age and 
ingredients. These ingredients include cement, fly ash, blast furnace slag, water, 
superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate. The proposed method was 
examined with different replacement percentage of fly ash and blast furnace slag to 
observe the strength behavior of FSC. A set of trial batches of FSC was carried out at 
the laboratory and the results were consistent with the prediction by this method.
